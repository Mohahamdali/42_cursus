42 Cursus
The 42 Cursus is a comprehensive curriculum offered by the 42 Network, designed to teach students programming and software engineering through hands-on projects and peer-to-peer learning. The curriculum emphasizes problem-solving, system-level programming, and mastering fundamental computer science concepts.

Curriculum Overview
The 42 Cursus is divided into several modules, each focused on specific topics in programming and software development. Some key areas of the curriculum include:

C Programming: Master the C programming language, including advanced topics such as memory management, system calls, and data structures.

Algorithms and Data Structures: Develop a deep understanding of algorithms (sorting, searching, graph algorithms) and data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues).

Unix and System Programming: Learn to work with Unix-like operating systems and develop system-level software, interacting directly with the operating system's APIs and understanding file systems, processes, and signals.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Gain proficiency in C++ and object-oriented design, focusing on classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and data abstraction.

Web Development: Explore front-end and back-end development, including web frameworks, databases, and networking concepts.

Security and Cryptography: Understand basic security principles, encryption algorithms, and how to secure applications and data.

Key Features
Peer-to-Peer Learning: The 42 Network promotes collaborative learning, where students work on projects together, helping each other to solve problems and understand new concepts.

No Formal Teachers: The 42 Network adopts a unique pedagogical approach without traditional professors. Students are evaluated based on their ability to solve problems and complete projects.

Project-Based Learning: Students complete various projects that simulate real-world development challenges. These projects are designed to push students beyond the basics, encouraging creativity and innovation.

Continuous Evaluation: The 42 curriculum is designed for self-paced learning, where studentsâ€™ progress is continually assessed through peer reviews, code evaluations, and the completion of increasingly difficult projects.

Key Skills Learned
Advanced problem-solving techniques

Efficient coding practices in C and other languages

Mastery of Unix-based systems and shell scripting

Development of robust software through systematic debugging and testing

Understanding of low-level system programming concepts

Communication and teamwork in a collaborative environment

Projects Included
Some notable projects in the 42 Cursus include:

Libft: Implement a custom C library containing commonly used functions.

Shell: Create a basic Unix shell to handle commands, processes, and signals.

Push Swap: Implement a sorting algorithm for a stack of integers using minimal operations.

Philosophers: Simulate a classic synchronization problem to understand concurrency and process synchronization.

Malloc: Implement a dynamic memory allocation system in C.

ft_server: Develop a basic web server to understand networking and client-server communication.

Getting Started
To begin learning in the 42 Cursus, students must be accepted into one of the 42 campuses around the world or complete the Online 42 Cursus program. The 42 Network follows a rigorous selection process, often involving a month-long coding challenge called The Piscine.
